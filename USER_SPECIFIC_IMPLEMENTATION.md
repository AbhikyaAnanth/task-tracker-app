# User-Specific Data Implementation

## Overview
The Task Tracker app now implements user-specific data storage, ensuring that each user only sees and manages their own tasks. This provides proper data isolation and privacy for multi-user scenarios.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates
- **Task Model**: Added `userId` field with ObjectId reference to User model
- **Index**: Added database index on `userId` for better query performance

### 2. Backend Security Updates
- **Authentication Middleware**: Enhanced to provide user context in requests
- **Task Controller**: All operations now filter by authenticated user's ID
- **Route Protection**: All task routes require authentication

### 3. Data Operations
- **Create Task**: Automatically associates new tasks with logged-in user
- **Get Tasks**: Only returns tasks belonging to the authenticated user
- **Update Task**: Only allows updating tasks owned by the user
- **Delete Task**: Only allows deleting tasks owned by the user

### 4. Migration Support
- **Migration Script**: Handles existing tasks without userId references
- **Automatic Migration**: Runs on server startup to ensure database consistency

## Security Features

### Data Isolation
- Users can only access their own tasks
- No cross-user data access possible
- Protected API endpoints with session-based authentication

### Error Handling
- Proper error messages for unauthorized access attempts
- "Not found" responses for tasks not owned by user
- Graceful handling of authentication failures

## Database Structure

### Before (Shared Tasks)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  completed: Boolean,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

### After (User-Specific Tasks)
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  title: String,
  description: String,
  completed: Boolean,
  userId: ObjectId, // References User._id
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

## API Endpoints

All task endpoints now require authentication and automatically filter by user:

- `GET /tasks` - Returns only current user's tasks
- `POST /tasks` - Creates task for current user
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Updates task if owned by current user
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Deletes task if owned by current user
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Returns task if owned by current user

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Register/login as User A and create tasks
2. Logout and register/login as User B
3. Verify User B cannot see User A's tasks
4. Create tasks as User B
5. Switch back to User A and verify data isolation

### Test Scripts
- `node scripts/test-user-data.js` - Verify user-specific data integrity
- `node scripts/migrate-tasks.js` - Run migration manually if needed

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
- Existing tasks without `userId` are automatically assigned to the first user found
- If no users exist, a default user is created
- Migration runs automatically on server startup

### Production Deployment
1. Backup database before deployment
2. Migration will run automatically on first startup
3. Verify user-specific data access after deployment

## Performance Considerations

- Database index on `userId` field for efficient querying
- Session-based authentication reduces database lookups
- Filtered queries prevent unnecessary data transfer

## Future Enhancements

- Team/workspace functionality for shared tasks
- Admin panel for user management
- Advanced permissions and roles
- Task sharing between specific users
